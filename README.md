## Steps to check the comparison of your Resume 
1. Open .ipynb file and click on colab and run All the cells, by clicking this.
2. After that, you will see this, in the first upload, paste your job description(Note: To import docx file only)
3. In the second upload section, import your resume.
4. And Kaboom, you will get to know how much your resume matches to job description -> ;) I Know mine won't
